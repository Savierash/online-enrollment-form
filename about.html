                <p> An innovative Philippine business institution, PHINMA always looks for ways to help
                    Filipinos attain better lives. In 2004, they realized that investing in education was key
                    to fully accomplishing their mission.
                    
                    Overall enrollment figures in the country have always been high. Despite this, attrition rates remained high and consistent. Out of four students who enter first grade, only one will go on to finish a tertiary degree. Learning about these statistics led PHINMA’s leaders to realize that they could fulfill their mission by helping improve the country’s state of education. With this in mind, they entered the education field to introduce reforms and innovations. In 2004, PHINMA Education was born.
                    
                    For more than a decade, PHINMA built its reputation on transforming existing educational institutions to better serve Filipino students. PHINMA Education begins this process by strategically selecting a school from a key growth area and thoroughly transforming its academics, operations, and student community in order to ensure success for Filipino youth coming from low-income families.
                    
                    PHINMA Education is under the PHINMA Group of Companies, the first Filipino-managed investment firm.</p>
